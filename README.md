# Claude Code Runner

Self hostable Claude Code runner to execute prompts from anywhere. Container accepts task prompts via HTTP and spawns Claude Code instance to autonomously implement them. Includes an integrated dashboard to submit tasks and monitor progress. Makes use of your Claude Code subscription instead of requiring an API key.

## Security

This service has no built-in authentication. It is expected to be hosted behind a VPN or private network that only you have access to. Do not expose to the public internet; doing so is a MAJOR security risk.

## How it Works

Claude Code uses your authenticated session from your OS (no API key). Claude Code will use your provided Github token to find your relevant repository, clone it, make requested changes based on your prompt, then open a PR. 

## Architecture

The system uses a two-stage LLM architecture:

### Orchestrator 

The first Claude instance receives your prompt and is responsible for:
- Parsing your task to identify which repository you're referring to
- Searching your GitHub repos via the `gh` CLI
- Cloning the target repository and setting up the environment
- Spawning a Worker Claude inside the cloned repo

The orchestrator handles all the setup so the worker can focus purely on coding.

### Worker 

A second Claude instance runs inside the cloned repository and:
- Picks up the repo's existing `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, and skills
- Opens a draft PR immediately so you can watch progress
- Commits and pushes after every logical change (no batching)
- Spawns subagents for complex tasks to preserve context
- On failure: commits current state, updates PR with blockers, then exits cleanly

## Quick Start

```bash
docker pull ericvtheg/claude-code-runner:latest
```

```yaml
services:
  claude-runner:
    image: ericvtheg/claude-code-runner:latest
    container_name: claude-code-runner
    ports:
      - "7334:3000"
    environment:
      - GITHUB_TOKEN=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
      - PORT=3000
    volumes:
      - ~/.claude:/home/node/.claude
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  claude-local:
```

## API

```bash
# Submit a task
curl -X POST http://localhost:7334/task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "In the acme-api repo, fix the token refresh bug"}'

# Check status
curl http://localhost:7334/task/<id>

# View logs
curl http://localhost:7334/task/<id>/logs

# Health check
curl http://localhost:7334/health
```

## Docker Image Tags

The project publishes Docker images to Docker Hub with the following tagging strategy:

- **Version tags** (e.g., `1.4.1`): Internal release images created automatically on every push to `main` that triggers a semantic release. Use these for testing new features before they're promoted to latest.
- **`latest` tag**: Stable release promoted manually via GitHub Actions. This is the recommended tag for production use.

### Promoting a Release

To promote a version to `latest`, use the "Promote Release to Latest" GitHub Action:

1. Go to Actions > "Promote Release to Latest"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Optionally specify a version (defaults to most recent release)
4. The workflow will pull the versioned image, tag it as `latest`, and push

## Requirements

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` with repo scope
- Claude authentication from your host machine

### Claude Authentication

The container uses your existing Claude Code authentication from the host machine. Before running the container, authenticate Claude Code on your host:

```bash
# On your host machine (not in Docker)
claude

# Follow the login prompts to authenticate with your subscription
```

This creates credentials at `~/.claude/` which get mounted into the container via the volume mount (`~/.claude:/home/node/.claude`). The container will use your subscription for all Claude API calls.
